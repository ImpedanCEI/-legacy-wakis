# Warp Basics
Instructions to install Warp


1) Install miniconda
This is a minimal python installation which is very flexible to install, manipulate and remove.
You install miniconda by running the following commands

```
cd
curl https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-py37_4.10.3-Linux-x86_64.sh
sh Miniconda3-py37_4.10.3-Linux-x86_64.sh
source Miniconda3/bin/activate
```

This install Python 3.7.4. The latest is 3.8, but there were some issues with Python 3.8 and Warp so letâ€™s stay with 3.7.4

2) Install Python packages needed for Warp (and more)

```
pip install numpy scipy Forthon picmistandard matplotlib
```

Off the top of my head these are the fundamental ones but there could be more.. 

3) Install Warp

```
git clone https://bitbucket.org/berkeleylab/warp.git
cd Warp/pywarp90
make install3
```

4) Test your installation

Open an interactive python session and test the installation by running the following commands:

```
ipython       #this opens the python session
from warp import *           #this imports warp in the Python session
```
